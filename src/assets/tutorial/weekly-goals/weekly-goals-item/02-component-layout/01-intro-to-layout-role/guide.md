## Component: Layout (Quarter Goals)

You have now learned to declare and style elements in a page. The second fundamental component of a webpage's view is its layout. In the *UI Component: Layout* role, you will be defining how the elements within an assigned component are laid out.

## What you will be doing and learning

You will be learning HTML for declaring the hierarchical structure of the individual elements and you will be learning SCSS for styling elements in relation to each other (layout direction, sizing, spacing, etc.). There are many ways to lay out elements in an HTML file, including *flexbox-based positioning, relative positioning, and grid-based positioning*. For the Weekly Goals Item component, you will be learning to use flexbox-based positioning.

## Step-by-step process

We will first introduce you to flexbox-based positioning and have you plan out how to decompose your component into groups of elements. Then you will style the container elements, specify direction and wrapping, and set size and scrolling, alignment, and spacing:

* Intro to Flexbox-based positioning
* Plan decomposition of component and create nested divs
* Style div containers with borders and background
* Specify direction and wrapping of div containers
* Set size and scrolling of div containers
* Set alignment of items within containers
* Set spacing from containers to items and between items
