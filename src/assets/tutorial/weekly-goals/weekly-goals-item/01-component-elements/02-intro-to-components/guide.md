## Component: Elements (Weekly Goals Item)

To create our component, we must first define its view, or how it is visually rendered. In the *UI Component: Elements* role, you will be learning to define all of the individual elements for one component. At this point, we will *not* be positioning those elements yet â€“ that will be done later in the layout role.

The component you will be developing in this section is the **Weekly Goals Item**. You can see the Figma design below within the design for the larger project that it is a part of, Compass. Don't lose track of this link as you will need to reference it when implementing your component:

## What you will be doing and learning:

You will be learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for *declaring* the elements of your widget and you will be learning SCSS (Sassy Cascading Style Sheets), a variant of CSS, for *styling* these declared elements (changing font color, thickness, style, etc.). This code is translated by a web browser into the view that a user sees. You'll also be introduced to Angular Material, a popular library used to build custom components like what we are doing.

## Step-by-step process

We will first introduce you to basics of HTML programming and declare text elements. Then you will be introduced to basics of SCSS styling to style the elements you've declared. Finally, you will learn to embedd an icon into the widget component.

* Introduction to HTML
* Declare text elements
* Introduction to SCSS
