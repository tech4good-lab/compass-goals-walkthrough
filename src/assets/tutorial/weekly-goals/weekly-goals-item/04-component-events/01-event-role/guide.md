## Component: Events (Quarter Goal)

In the *UI Component: Events* role, you will learn to bind user events to functions that handle these events. This is the first step towards enabling our component to dynamically change when the user performs some action, such as a mouse-click. The Quarter Goal only has a single event triggered when clicking the pencil icon to edit tasks.

## What you will be doing and learning

You will be learning basic <a href="https://angular.io/guide/event-binding" target="_blank">Angular event binding</a> syntax. Like in the <em>UI Component: Data</em> role, this role assumes that you know Javascript. If you don't, you can learn Javascript from any of these resources and then revisit this role: <a href="https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/" target="_blank">Javascript in 14 minutes</a>, <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/javascript-introduction" target="_blank">Sololearn</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a>.

## Step-by-step process

We will first introduce you to event binding, have you review and test the output events that the component needs to emit, and then finally bind and handle the single user event for your component:

* Review and test component outputs
* Bind event and emit: open edit event
