## Component: Data (Quarter Goals)

You have now learned how to use HTML and SCSS to define the component view. So far, however, all of our text, images, and styles have been *hard-coded* into our webpage. Although this is enough for defining static webpages, more complex, dynamic web applications have content that is different for different users and that changes over time as users create, edit, or delete content in an application. In the *UI Component: Data* role, you will be defining the view of a widget so that it is "bound to" data variables, i.e. so that it automatically updates whenever these data variables change.

## What you will be doing and learning

You will be learning basic <a href="https://angular.io/guide/binding-overview" target="_blank">data binding</a> syntax within Angular, a frontend JavaScript framework. Because you will be manipulating data objects and creating functions that utilize variable assignments, conditionals, iterative loops, etc., this role assumes that you  already have some understanding of Javascript. If you don't, don't worry! You can learn Javascript from any of these resources and then revisit this role: <a href="https://jgthms.com/javascript-in-14-minutes/" target="_blank">Javascript in 14 minutes</a>, <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/learn/courses/javascript-introduction" target="_blank">Sololearn</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank">Codeacademy</a>.

Angular uses a variant of Javascript called <a href="https://typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">Typescript</a>, which supports variable type declarations and is tremendously helpful for catching bugs in large projects. Because Typescript is a superset of Javascript, any valid <code>.js</code> code is also valid <code>.ts</code> code, but small syntactical differences will be easy to pick up along the way.

## Step-by-step process

We will first introduce you to Angular and data binding and have you review and test the input data that the component needs to bind. Then we will implement content, collection, and conditional bindings:

* Intro to Angular
* Intro to Angular data binding and component inputs
* Review and test component inputs
* Create content bindings
* Create collection bindings
* Create conditional bindings
